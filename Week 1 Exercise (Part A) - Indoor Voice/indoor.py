# In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input
# in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user
# explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

# Step 1: Ask the user for his/her input
name = input("What do you want to write? ")

# Step 2: Change the name to lower case and print the name out
print(name.lower())
